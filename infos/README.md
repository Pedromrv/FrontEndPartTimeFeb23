## My BeCode

[mybecode.org](https://my.becode.org/) is one of our main tool regarding organisation and admin parts. 
This is where you deal with your becode profile, attendances, tech talks, badges, events... 

Your coach will quickly show you how to use it. But if your are lost, you can consult [the help section](https://my.becode.org/help)

## People to contact for resources

Is there something wrong? Do you have a question?  
Here is a list of people who can help you during your adventure with us.

### You

I know it sounds stupid, but your first resource is you.  
Most of the information, help, answers are at your fingertips, often via a little Google search.

Do yourself a favour and always start your research on your own. You'll see, it's all the more rewarding when you find it.
 
### Your group / your promo

We are all in the same boat!  
BeCode is not a competition: your group is your strength. The more advanced help those who know less.  
It's super beneficial: _The best way to know if you've understood something is when you're able to transmit it_.

And believe me, you will know things that other people don't know, and they'll be thrilled to learn.

### Your godmother/godfather

The Hamilton's 6 learners started in February 2022.  
They are a little further down the road than you are, and they have gone through the same hardships as you have.  
You were assigned a godmother/godfather at the beginning of your adventure. He or she is there to help you and pass on tips and tricks, soothe your anxieties and encourage you.

And soon... you too will be the godfather or godmother of the next Hamilton 7!

Giving and receiving. This is our _credo_.

### The coaches

We're here for you... when all else fails. We'll check üôÉ  
However, be careful: we are not here to give you the answers, but to help you find them.

In case of a slackening, loss of motivation, great metaphysical questioning... comes to us.  
We're on your side, our goal is to make your BeCode adventure as productive as possible.

> üë∑‚Äç The technical specialities of the Li√®ge team are diverse and complementary, that's what makes our strength!

## The rituals of BeCode

At BeCode, we're going to follow a steady rhythm (we have no time to lose!), and the best way to keep up is to create a series of rituals that will punctuate our work.
Here is a list of our rituals:

### Launch of the day

Every morning at 9:00 a.m. sharp, the day begins. Followed with a little word from the coaches and the program of the day.  
It's the opportunity to let us know if you want a helping hand from the group, or a clarification on anything.

### The tech talk

Every day at BeCode, we do the tech talk. It's as casual as a nap, except you learn a few things.  
What's a tech talk? It's all explained on [MyBeCode/help](https://my.becode.org/help).

#### The double tech talk

Particularity of Li√®ge, you don't have one, but _two_ tech talks every day (and for the same price): at 1.30 pm and 3.15 pm.  
One tech talk at the Jepsen's (which you are **required** to attend) and one tech talk at the Hamilton's (optional, but you would be wrong to do without).  
Even if the Hamilton's are _a little_ ahead of us, attending their tech talk is never a waste of time: you will discover advanced techniques, useful tools, inspiration for future work.


### _English_ 

No matter what you think, English is a must in our milieu. You will soon realize that the best resources are in English, and you will get used to it very quickly.

In order to help us all to improve (_it's by forging that we become blacksmiths_.), our focus will be towards English, but there is still possibility to speak French if needed. And it doesn't matter if we make mistakes: we're here to improve. The coaches too :)

### The debriefing

Regularly (at least twice a week, sometimes more, depending on the needs), at the end of the day, we do a _debrief_: we take an overview of the past days, the strong moments and the difficulties encountered.  
This helps us to see where everyone is at, and you to see if you can help (or get help) from another learner who is able to do so.

## The P√¥le Image Li√®ge

The PIL is a huge building with lots and lots of companies. In order to keep everything running, there are internal regulations that you can consult.

The PIL has, in particular, meeting rooms, a canteen, a bicycle parking, a gym (10‚Ç¨/month), an arcade, a magnificent terrace ect... While being in Becode, you will be able to benefit from this exceptional place to learn in the best conditions.

If you need to book a meeting room, ask your coaches, they will book one for you.

## Activities

You'll soon realize that in our community, networking is **very important**.
Fortunately, we have a lot of activities, at BeCode or elsewhere, that will allow you to meet developers, potential employers, internship providers, etc...

### Hackathon

There are a ton of hackathon & we will encourage you to participate to them. 
If a hackathon is during the BeCode's hours, don't worry, you can go (just inform your coaches). 
Often your coaches will give you some rest after a hackathon because you'll deserve it ! 

### Dev Talk Li√®ge

_Coming soon_

### Coder Dojo

Every second Wednesday of the month, Becode learners organize a CoderDojo.
A CoderDojo is an introductory coding workshop for children between 7 and 17 years old. If you want to know more about it ask the Jepsens that take care of this.
You will surely participate in at least one CoderDojo before the end of your training.
