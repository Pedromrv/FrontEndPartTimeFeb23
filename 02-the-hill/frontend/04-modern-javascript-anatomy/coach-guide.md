# Modern javascript applications

- Maintainer: `Tim Broos`

## Suggested approach & a bit of context
- This exercise needs a (basic) JS codebase they built before, so it can be modernised. (example: weather app)
- Start the day with a short demo or intro about the topic for that day.
- The first step (refactoring) might take a real while, depending on what code they are using. If you feel that is a hurdle, we can consider providing some code to start with for them.
- Should you need it, there is a sample project provided (in case a learner or class doesn't have a suitable one)
