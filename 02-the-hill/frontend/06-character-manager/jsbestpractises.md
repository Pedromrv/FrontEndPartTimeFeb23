# JS Best Practises

## Formatting & naming
- ALWAYS stick to the existing convention in a project
- Nesting / deeper levels (use spaces, tabs can very per operating system)
- Don't mix spaces and tabs (tips: make them visible!)
- Check formatting for functions, ifs and loops
- Use camelCase for variables (example: totalCount)
- Use `"` instead of `'` (better compatible with things like JSON)
- Avoid abbreviations (clarity over brevity)
- Lowercase for filename, avoid spaces
- Functions should do one thing
- (optional tips) check if your IDE supports a linter (not necessary to install big things via terminal, just a plugin is fine for now)

## Modern syntax

- Const and let
- Fat arrow functions (=>)
- Use [Template literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals) to concatenate. 

## Structure
- Avoid global variables
- Declare your variables (mostly) at the top for better overview
