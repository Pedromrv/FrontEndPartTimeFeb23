## Intro

It's time to move forward & learn React through a project. 

We expect you to know how to use React hooks and create JSX components.
You should also be familiar as for how to route between components and pass information through them.

Now, we can use that new knowledge to have some fun! 

## Instructions
You will have a week (4 days + 1 day to fix and finish).

You are free to choose a topic for your project (or use suggested projects below). But should not be spending more than an hour finding a topic!

**All topics need to have all the following requirements given below as well.**

### Requirements

> Multiple pages/components.
> 
> Updating data on change/filter.
> 
> Loading data on page load.
> 
> Installing a package/library to use
> 
> Passing props through components.
>
> Using a router (if necessary)

#### Ideas (hard ðŸŒ³)
- Photo gallery with firebase

> Disclaimer: YouTube series can take a long time and come over as "the only way". Don't focus on tutorials over exercise, try out multiple options. Combine the two or look for a specific topic instead.

## Good luck and have fun!
