The goal of this exercise is to create a Doodle clone. Most of the fetch exercises, such as the Pokedex, focus on data consumption, this adds a new layer of complexity by adding POST/PATCH/DELETE requests to the mix.

This can be either given before front-end frameworks such as React (and offers a great opportunity to refactor the code afterwards), or after.

I gave this project as the last challenge before heading to backend development, and could serve as an introduction if needed.

It could be useful to refer to tools such as Postman (or Insomnia) to grasp the concept of queries and endpoints, but it is up to each coach to tackle this exercise the way they feel it.
