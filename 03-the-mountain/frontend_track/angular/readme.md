# Angular

Welcome to the Angular repo. 

Angular is a (big) JS Framework used essential for building software (not so for website solutions). Anyway, it uses JS and especially Typescript. Before beginning an Angular training, we advise to learn a bit [Typescript](../typescript) first. 

Angular is updated very often, but be carefull, the first version of Angular, called AngularJS, is outdated. So the best way to learn Anglar is to follow their tutorial on their website : https://angular.io/start


Enjoy your trip !
