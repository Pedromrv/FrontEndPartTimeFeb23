## Suggested approach & a bit of context

To start this exercise, a presentation of what typescript is and how it works will help a lot.
- Explaining that Typescript doesn't work on every browser -> use of builders
- Example of when typescript can be useful

The first mission is quite simple, and when learners finished the must-have's they can be instructed to try to use more strict types. After that, Webpacks can be implemented too.

The second part is more a consolidation exercise, to get more familiar with typescript. Depending on the level of the learners this may also be a short exercise. This is why I suggest giving them the time that's left over to clean up and optimize this exercise, so it can be used as a portfolio item later on.
