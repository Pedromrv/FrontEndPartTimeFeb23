# Mini Trading App Frontend

For this challenge you'll have to build a frontend application on top the [Trading API](../backend/) from your backend counterparts. The frontend should be deisgned as a Single Page Application (SPA) dashboard using the `react-router` library.

Through API calls you will be able to open simple positions (buy) then close them later (sell everything at once).


## User stories

These are some views you could develop on the API.

- As a visitor I should be facing a `home screen` offering two choices :
  - A login page, that allow me to log into the platform
  - A register page, that allow me to create a new account on the platform using a nickname and a password
- As a logged in user I should not be able to see the `home screen`
- As a logged in user I should be able to deposit some money on my account in order to fill my account
- As a logged in user I should be able to open a position (buy) at the price given by the API
- As a logged in user I should be able to close my positions
- As a logged in user I should be able to check my account balance
- As a logged in user I should see the amount gained or loss through past transactions

Make sure to create some wireframes of your project first. Your goal as a frontend developper is not only to display the information but also to make it look nice. Feel free to use libraries to display nice graphs, or animations.
