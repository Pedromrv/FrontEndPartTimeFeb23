# Pitch my status

In The Mountain, we have many projects at once, so we will implement regarding the Tech Talks a "Pitch my Status".

## The why

Because, your are now divided in little teams & sometimes you work alone. 

Because it's important to share your ideas with your colleages and maybe get some pieces of advice. 

Because in a profesional eco-system you will have to support (or even sell) your projects. 

## The what 

This is a recurrent presentation event during which working groups share to the team where they stand.
You have 15 minutes per group to answer the following questions:

- What is the project, its purpose, for which client, which audience?
- The resources and technologies used?
- What stage of progress the group is at (mockup, development, customer meeting,...)
- What problems did the group encounter and if the group found solutions to these problems, what were the solutions?
- What are the next steps?

## The how

- Two persons max per group. One person is nice too
- Max 15 minutes
- Make a slide presentation 
- Hold a question/feedback session after the presentation
