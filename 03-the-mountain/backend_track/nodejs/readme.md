# Creating Backend Application with Node.js

Are you looking to develop applications with real-time capabilities ? Build APIs in a few lines of code ? Use your javascript knowledge beyond the frontend realm ? You have come to the right place!

Node.js is a Javascript environment that is mainly used as a backend language. In this series we'll try to cover up the basics to get you up and running. Before diving in, make sure you have a good understanding of the Javascript language!

## What are we going to build ?

As you'll soon notice, Node.js is a powerful tool when it comes to RESTful API creation, it works best when used with a decoupled frontend (a mobile or web application). In this introduction we're going to develop our backend to be completely frontend-agnostic, thus solely focusing on data logic.
