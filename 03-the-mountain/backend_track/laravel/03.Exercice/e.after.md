# Next steps ?

From now on, you should have a solid basic understanding of how the Laravel framework organizes its content,
and how you can create Models, Views, Controllers and Routes !

For the next steps, I would advise you to either follow a complete Laravel course,
such as Laracasts, complete one of the challenges provided in this repository,
or create your own small application !

You can of course, as alwas, refer to the resources linked in the introduction :

* [The Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x)
* [Laravel from Scratch on Laracasts](https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-8-from-scratch) (still valid with Laravel 9)
* [Laravel Daily Youtube Channel + their Laravel roadmap](https://github.com/LaravelDaily/Laravel-Roadmap-Learning-Path)
* [Tuto FR from Gekkode](https://www.gekkode.com/developpement/tutoriel-laravel-8-pour-les-debutants/)
