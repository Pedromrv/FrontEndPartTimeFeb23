## The most important directories to keep in mind

* Models are in the **app/Models** directory
* Controllers are in the **app/Http/Controllers** directory
* Views are in the **resources/views** directory
* Migrations are in the **database/migrations** directory
* Routes are in the **routes** directory

Remain that to add some style and some javascript, you need to place them in the **public** folder!
(Or, you want to use tailwind or sass in your project, you have to use [Vite](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/vite) which is bundled with Laravel by default.)
