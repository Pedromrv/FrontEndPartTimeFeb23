# Sail

> Laravel Sail is a light-weight command-line interface for interacting with Laravel's default Docker development environment. Sail provides a great starting point for building a Laravel application using PHP, MySQL, and Redis without requiring prior Docker experience.

For the installation of *Sail*, the best method is to follow Laravel's documentation as it describes every step of the process
and gives you some examples regarding the *starter-packs* you might want to use : [https://laravel.com/docs/9.x#laravel-and-docker](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x#laravel-and-docker).

### 1. Prerequisites

The prerequisites might change according to your OS : 
* On Linux : [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) should be installed.
* On MacOS : [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) should be installed.
* On Windows : [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and [WSL2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) have to be installed.
Then you should [configure Docker Desktop to use WSL2](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/wsl/).

### 2. Creating a new application

Once the prerequisites installed, you can create a new Laravel project by simply running a script in your terminal :
> curl -s https://laravel.build/my-application | bash

By default, the generated docker-compose file will contain multiple containers you won't need, so you can instead use this 
command to get a simplified Laravel application running with mysql :
> curl -s "https://laravel.build/my-application?with=mysql" | bash

### 3. Starting your Laravel app

Once the sail installation finished, you can boot up the Laravel server and all containers using the sail command-line tool.
For this, you will need to navigate to the directory where you app lives (`cd my-application`), and run the following command : 

> ./vendor/bin/sail up

Once the command finishes the installation and boot, you will access your laravel app in your web browser at [http://localhost](http://localhost).
### 4. Next steps and using Sail

For the rest of this tutorial, if you need to use a command-line script, you will need to use sail in order to execute it *inside*
the php container of Docker.

For example, the following script : `php artisan migrate` will need to be changed to `./vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate`.

The *Sail* documentation also explains how to [execute commands](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/sail#executing-sail-commands)
**and** how to [set an alias](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/sail#configuring-a-bash-alias) on bash, allowing you to avoid 
writing `./vendor/bin/sail` each time you need to execute a command.
