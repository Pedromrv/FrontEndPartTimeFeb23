# Installation

Now you know how a laravel application is based on, it is time to start a new project.

For this, you have two choices : 
* The new standard installation method, using *Sail*, the Laravel **docker compose** built-in solution.
* Composer, the PHP package manager

I would personally recommend using Sail as it takes care of a lot the configuration out-of-the-box.
But if PHP is installed localy on your machine, you can also use Composer.
