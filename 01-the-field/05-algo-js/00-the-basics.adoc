Computers are powerful machines able to calculate and produce all kinds of
output amazingly fast. However, they are not (yet) able to imagine and create by
themselves, that's were programmers come into play.

Programming is essentially writing *sets of instructions* that a computer can
understand to *create* a desired program, making the programmer a linguist of
sort. Yet, for the computer to understand you, you have to think like a
computer, you have to think {algo}[algorithmically].

It can be difficult to translate human thinking into computer logic. To help
with that you can write your algorithm in {pseudo_code}[pseudo code], a
higher-level language closer to human speech.

Writing your algorithm in pseudo code before writing in actual code allows for a
language-agnostic approach were *what matters is the logic not the syntax*.

There is no set-in-stone way to write pseudo code, as long as the algorithm is
clear. Still, for easier communication between everyone you could write yours
following this sets of link:./conventions.adoc[conventions].

NOTE: You could also represent your algorithm with {flowchart}[flowchart].

== The mission

Before you learn how to write *code* you have to complete the following
mini games. They will develop your programming logic and allow you an easier
time down the road.

.Instructions
* complete http://silentteacher.toxicode.fr/[silent teacher]
* complete https://code.org/minecraft[minecraft]

=== Optional

* complete this https://studio.code.org/s/20-hour[extensive challenge]


== Congrats

Although it might feel weird to think algorithmically, in time it will become a
second nature to break problems into their smallest parts.
