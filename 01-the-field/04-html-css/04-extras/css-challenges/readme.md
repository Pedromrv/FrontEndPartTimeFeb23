# The Design Challenges

Here are a few challenges, classed by difficulty, coming from [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/) (a website for designers to share their graphics projects), the [100DaysCSSChallenge](https://100dayscss.com/about/) or Youtube.

> The question is: How will I do if I had to integrate these designs into HTML, CSS & JavaScript 😨?

## What should I do?

The goal here is to make some new, tricky CSS over fun & stylish concepts.

For each challenge, reproduce the concept _as much as you can_.  
Of course, do as you can for images or external resources. Be creative!

### Use CodePen

For the challenges, we will use [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) - a website to work on small concepts without having to set a whole local env. It's very useful - I let you discover its advantages.

Just login/sign in with your GitHub account, **create a public collection** and create one _pen_ per challenge.  
👉 Don't forget to put the original concept link and its creator in the _pen_ details.

### The challenges

Your _beloved_ coaches have selected these challenges classed by difficulty.
To get the most out of these exercices, we advise to code at least **2 projects from the Easy and Middle series, and 1 project from the last serie**.
Think **pixel perfect!**

At the end of the week, just send us **the link to you CodePen collection**.
Btw, it's not because your code is on Codepen that you cannot publish it on Github Pages to show on your Portfolio or during a job interview 😉
