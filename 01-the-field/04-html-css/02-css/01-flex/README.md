## Mission objectives

## Exercise

We all remember those little games we have/had on our windows computers. Pinball, Patience, Minesweeper, ...
Well, today we are just going to make just that. A Minesweeper!
Now, don't worry, all I want it a static moment of the game, similar to the one displayed below.

You don't have to make an exact copy of the minefield, but try to have the following:

- Borders made by using CSS only.
- Little squares that will represent the field
- Lines that divide the field
- Bombs
- Numbers

Make a minefield that looks like the image below, using Flexbox.  
(You don't need to make an exact copy!)  
(Does not **_have_** to be responsive!)

***Note:** The minefield should be centred on the web page!*

<p align="center">
    <img src="./assets/minefield.png" alt="Minefield example!">
</p>

### Bonus

On hover: The invisible boxes show the content that is hidden (bomb or number).
