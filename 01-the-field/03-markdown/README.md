# Markdown


## What is markdown?

**Markdown** is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. Its design allows it to be converted to many output formats. Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor.


With it we can do fancy things like showing code and many more things...


```js
let markdown = true;

if(markdown === true)
{
	PARTY();
}
```
_Just an example_

The markdown files have the extension `.md`. 

To know the syntax of markdown, you can check here : [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

> :point_right: Do you know it ? On discord, you can write with the markdown syntax to improve your messages style ;)
