## Intro

Welcome to the algorithm challenges !

In this section, you will find (almost) daily challenges related to algorithmic problems.
Most of these questions regularly appear in technical interviews and being not too complicated, are a good way to start.

Please note that the code examples are given in various programming languages, and are simply there as examples, not
as a requirement.

Take your time to understand the problem, and think about the solution _before_ starting to code. If you need to, take
a sheet of paper and make a diagram or a text to explain your solution. Then, translate that solution into code.
If needed (and it does happen in some interviews), you should be able to explain (by text or orally) _how_ you
would resolve an algorithmic question without even writing a line of code.
