# Daily Challenges

In a lot of (tech) companies, algorithms and coding problems are the main part of the technical side of the interview process.
Even if their future job might not require the use of specific algorithms, it is still a good way to see if the interviewee
is able to think about a problem, and be able to design a solution, translate it to code, and test it. In a few words, we could
say that this is _a measure_ (not the only one of course) of the _problem-solving_ skills of the candidate.

## Learning objectives

- Develop analytical skills and be able to develop the most optimal solution in a finite amount of time.
- Practice coding skills by translating an algorithm into code in your language of choice.
- Discover (not so) traditional interview questions and prepare yourself for future interviews.
